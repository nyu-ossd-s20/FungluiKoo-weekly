title: "Week 2: A Taste of Group Collaboration"
---

This is the second week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University. Students in this course were randomly divided into several groups, with each of them 3 students. I was assigned into Group#5, working with [Sylvia Ji](https://github.com/sylviaji) and [Kyle Nelson](https://github.com/fieldchicken). With a group, students will collaboratively build up an extension that works on FireFox browser. And we decided to make an extension that can add three real-time clocks to the screen, each for one of the degree-granting campus of New York University (NYU) around the world.

Before all, we have little experience in JavaScript, so we made use of the [intro material](https://github.com/joannakl/ossd_materials/blob/master/activities/browser_add-on_activity.md). After a [quick bite](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/activity1_browser_extension/blob/master/team_5.md) of what an extension should be like, we started off.

We came up with three ideas on this project: (1) to identify the font of any text element on the page; (2)to add a clock to the page with a selected time zone; (3) Make any webpage look like the login page of [NYU Albert](albert.nyu.edu). Then we decided to build an extension that shows the local time of the three NYU degree-granting campuses around the world.

[Sylvia Ji](https://github.com/sylviaji) created the repository for our project. She also found some icons to be chosen as the avartar of our extension. I figured out the relation of time conversion of these three cities: New York City (GMT-5), Abu Dhabi (GMT+4), and Shanghai (GMT+8). Also, I found a [webpage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString) that would be useful for our project. I suggested that the following codes might be useful.

<code>
    
var shanghaiTime = new Date().toLocaleString("en-US", {timeZone: "Asia/Shanghai"});
    
sh = new Date(shanghaiTime);
    
console.log('Asia time: '+sh.toLocaleString());
    
var nycTime = new Date().toLocaleString("en-US", {timeZone: "America/New_York"});
    
nyc = new Date(nycTime);
    
console.log('USA time: '+nyc.toLocaleString());
    
</code>

But up to now, we haven't finished yet. We still need to implement the js and css codes.

Through this project, I learned the basic knowledge on JavaScript and web programming. Also, I gained practice of group communications and collaboration. I hope that I could work well in all kinds of group coding projects in the future.
