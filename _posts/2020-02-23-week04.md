title: "Week 4: Open Data Forum"
---

This is the fourth week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University. There is no lecture this week for the Open Source course, and no assignment were posted on the course website.

There was a "forum" on Open Data, where Prof. Deena Engel from NYU CS Department and Librarian Vicky Steeves from NYU Courant Library were invited. They shared their knowledge and experience in this field.
