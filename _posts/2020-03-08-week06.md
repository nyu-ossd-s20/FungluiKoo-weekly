title: "Week 6: Vicky's Talk and Project Evaluation Continued"
---

This is the sixth week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University. This week is like a miscellanea without a specific topic, so I will introduce it in two parts: (1) Vicky' talk on reproducibility and some issues with regard to open source software development; (2) open source software project evaluation (continued).

On Monday, we again have [Vicky](https://vickysteeves.com/) invited to give us a speech. She points out that, many, if not all, experiments will have a different result if conducted by another person. I can't agree more on that - actually when I was doing molecular and cell biology labs in high school (cause I was preparing for the China National Biology Olympiad), I often got imperfect results so that I had to redo it. In light of this, Vicky's statement is not exaggerating, as these results might even differ when doing by the same person. However, I believe that such situations would be significantly relieved if there were more user-friendly documentations and handy instructions/tools.

When it comes to the realm of Computer Science, the reproducibility crisis was once a forbidding issue. To solve this, programmers start to use functions and encapsulations, templates and containers. And experiments of computer could be reproduced by environment simulators like a virtual machine/hyporvisor. For example, our CS202 Operating Systems course are using [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

Vicky also suggests that the openess of open source platforms and communities is of critical importance. This helps me understand why there are [concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17474284/microsoft-github-acquisition-developer-reaction) about [Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjayta5uYzoAhX9mXIEHZ4UDK8QFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.microsoft.com%2Fblog%2F2018%2F10%2F26%2Fmicrosoft-completes-github-acquisition%2F&usg=AOvVaw0P8749bUI8SliJCEXS6-8o).

Nevertheless, there is always a way. GitLab is an alternative, whereas getting a copy on open machine is also a choice. And GitHub is designed to be decentralized, not centralized, so it's not too bad a news.


On Wednesday, we proceeded on our open source project evaluation. I was fortunate enough as my evaluation got picked in class to show. Unfortunately, (and I didn't know why) my evaluation markdown file turned out to be broken in formatting. At least, I was sure that it could display well on my VSCode on my local machine, but GitHub seems to have a different interpretation on my markdown file, so I have to modify and resubmit it again.

As for now, I am thinking on Jupyter.
