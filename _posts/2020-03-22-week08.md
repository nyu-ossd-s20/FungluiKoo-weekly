title: "Week 8: A Spring Break without Break"
---

What expected finally came.

This is the eighth week of Spring 2020 at New York University. This week is scheduled to be a spring break by academic calendar. 

I planed to visit Washington, DC and Boston; and I had all the reservations. But due to the coronavirus outbreak (click [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us)) for updated cases map provided by New York Post), however, a lot happened and my vacation trip was spoiled :(

On Mar 16, NYU President Andrew Hamilton sent a [letter](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/communications/update-on-covid-19.html) ordering all residents living on campus to move out of campus formitory immediately, preferably within 48 hours. He also mentioned that the New York State Governor had asked for army to enter the State. On the same day, New York City Mayor said that NYC may be locked down soon. UPDATE: New York has been locked down as of Mar 21 ([link](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-20200320-hiya77j3w5brjbt7lbkrvcmeve-story.html)).

Later that day, I began searching where to move. The first question was whether to stay in the U.S.. Taken into account of F-1 immigration status and the forseeable matters of visa reapplication, I decided to remain in the U.S.. I contacted several of my friends who are also attending college in the U.S.. But before recieving their reply, I had to take a bath and to go to sleep.

In the following days, I got their responses: most of them decided to remain in the U.S., at least till mid-April. In the meantime, I talked with my parents to discuss about it, and they recommend me not to return to China right now. So I decided to follow their suggestions. But then the second question comes: where to go? Clearly, New York is no longer a good place to stay. But as a foreigner who is not familiar with the country at all, it could be challenging for me to move to another place. So I turned to my friends again. Many of my friends are now studying at [University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). They told me the spread of coronavirus there were limited and local supermarkets were in good operations. However, Ann Arbor, which is well-known for its long winter, might seem too cold for me, whose hometown is in a warm and sub-tropical city. On the other hand, I have several friends who are attending [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). But the condition in California is not better than New York. So where should I go?
