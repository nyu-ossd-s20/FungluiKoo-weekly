title: "Week 11: Topic & Project Continued"
---

This is the eleventh week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University. This week, we picked up what we left last week. Also each group in the course are required to present their progress for the final project.


On Monday, we talked about our feelings for the two classes in the last week. There are a lot of positive feedback, and I feel the same too :) Actually, such mode of teaching is very rare in my academic career (which have lasted for 14 years). And thus it's a great experience. And personally, Gil's speech is more interesting than previous guests. Though he spoke across the screen to us, I felt him even closer than physically standing in front of us. Professor also talked about Wikipedia that day. To make class more interesting, professor asked us to guess which is the biggest open source project in the world. It turned out to be Wikipedia! She also made a poll asking us to guess how many entries there are in Wikipedia. In such way, there are more interactions in the class, even though our class is conducted remotely. 

For my personal experience, Wikipedia has been playing a critical rule in my studying since high school. Back then, I was using Wikipedia with my Biology Olympiad studying. (There is a contest called [International Biology Olympiad](https://www.ibo-info.org/en/) that tests students' knowledge in the field of biology. Almost every country and their provinces or states have their regional-level biology olympiad.) And when I went to college, I used it a lot for my Math courses. In the mean time, I also used it a lot after class in leisure time. You know what? I love reading history, and there are actually a lot of entries with regard to all kinds of world history events. And more importantly: all are free and paperless! Recently, I also began to contribute my own knowledge about my hometown, Hangzhou, to Wikipedia. There have already existed quite some entries in Chinese, but I would like to make more in English.


On Wednesday, each group in the course is supposed to present their progress for the final project. Unfortunately, however, due to time limie, there were three groups left not presented and they have to present next Monday. Our group, on the other hand, was lucky enough to present it that day. Before the class, all four of our group members gathered on Slack distributing the work for presentation. I am responsible for introduction of our project chosen - [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab). For better presentation, I also made some [slides](https://nyu-ossd-s20.github.io/FungluiKoo-weekly/slides/JupyterLab_Intro.pdf) to faciliate conveying our ideas. 


By the way, I am now feeling more and more confident with Git Version Control System! The seeds that were planted last month is now growing!
