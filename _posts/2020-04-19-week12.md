title: "Week 12: COVID-19 Open Efforts & HFOSS"
---

This is the eleventh week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University.

On Monday in class, the last three groups who were left off last week shared their progress and projects. Then we moved on to talk about the open efforts that communities are making to help with other people in COVID-19. Due to time limit, about half of the students in class couldn't get chance to share their findings. On Wednesday in class, the remaining students shared their findings of COVID-19 open efforts. And after that, Professor started a new topic, Humanitarian Free and Open Source.

Humanitarian free and open source software (HFOSS) represents the application of free and open source software (FOSS) to the coordination problems faced in the humanitarian and disaster-response domains. It is also software related to: Human rights, Advocacy, Development Cooperation, Assistive/Accessible Technologies. It can be oberserved that there is an alignment of values/thoughts/ideas in open course and humanitarian. The examples of HFOSS include, all the social good projects, such as those open COVID-19 projects mentioned above! 

As for our group, we met on Wednesday after class. We talked about some issues that we could contribute to. We found one idea quite interesting: to translate the JupyterLab into multi-langugages, though we haven't come up with a way to implement it.
