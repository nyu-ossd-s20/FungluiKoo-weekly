title: "Week 13: HFOSS continued and Business Models around Open Source"
---

This is the 13th week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University.

On Monday in class, we finished up with the Humanitarian free and open source software (HFOSS), which represents the application of free and open source software (FOSS) to the coordination problems faced in the humanitarian and disaster-response domains. By the way, I think I will take a deeper look at [alex](https://alexjs.com/) after this semester ends (or when I have spare time).

On Wednesday in class, professor talked about some business models centered around open source projects. I was surprised that there are so successful open-source projects that could be profit-making. Previously, I thought open-source meant no-profit and donation-needed.

As for our group, we met on Wednesday after class through Facebook Messenger. We created our [course wiki page](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/wiki/wiki/JupyterLab:-Group-4) to show our contributions. We also shared our new findings and some technical issues related. Due to some personal issues, I am unfortunately not able to spend much time on this course; also, I am not very familiar with TypeScript which we finally come to (our initial plan for the Jupyter Notebook was supposed to be something Python I think). Thus, I plan to pass/fail this course.
