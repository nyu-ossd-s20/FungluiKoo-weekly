title: "Week 14: Group Stand-up Report & Unfortunate Cancellations"
---

This is the 14th week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University.

On Monday in class, our group, among with other groups in class, talked about our latest updates and progress. Unfortuately, my WiFi is not stable and had very limited internet connection suring that class. Fortunately, my partners are very supportive and they helped to cover my part. And professor gave positive feedbacks.

For the Wednesday class, unfortunately, professor had some personal issues so that the class was cancelled. I felt very interested in that topic, bash and command line tools. Maybe I will have to learn them by myself in summer.

As for our group, our regular weekly Wednesday after-class meeting was also cancelled, as Quang had some personal events. In the meantime, I submitted the pass/fail petition to CAS.
