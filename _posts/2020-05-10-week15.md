title: "Week 15: Group Project Presentations"
---

This is the 15th week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University.

As Final is coming to the corner, all of the groups in this class are going to do their final presentation. On Monday in class, [Group 6](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/wiki/wiki/p5.js:-Group-6) presented their [p5.js](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/p5.js). On Wednesday in class, [Group 7](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/wiki/wiki/Inky:-Group-7) presented [Inky](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/inky), [Group 12](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/wiki/wiki/freeCodeCamp:-Group-12) presented [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/freeCodeCamp), [Group 2](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/wiki/wiki/OpenFoodFacts:-Group-2) presented [OpenFoodCamp](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/openfoodfacts-server).

On Wednesday after class, our regular weekly meeting continued on Messenger. Professor scheduled our group to present on May 15. However, Barkin says he couldn't make our final presentation on that day due to a time conflict with his flight back home. We were worrited about not being able to finish all the contributions before the presentation, but we all can understand him, given this difficult time for the Coronavirus pendemic. So we decided to make it on May 11 instead. Plus, professor said it's okay to leave some work after the presentation, and we can do before the end of this semester. Later Barkin sent this message to the Professor and thankfully Professor is willing to help.

As the presentation is approaching, we created a Google doc to collaboratively do a presentation slide. I will do the introduction and community interaction part. Quang will do the pull requests and bug analysis part. Barkin will do the documentation and website part. Amad will do his papermill stuff and the conclusion part.
