title: "Week 16: Group Project Presentations"
---

This is the 16th week of our [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20) course at New York University.

On Monday, our group delivered our final presentation. I am responsible for the introduction to JupyterLab part, as well as community interaction part. Due to our preference and privacy concerns, we decided not to make our slides public. So I will only show [my part](https://nyu-ossd-s20.github.io/FungluiKoo-weekly/slides/Intro_Community_Interactions.pdf).
